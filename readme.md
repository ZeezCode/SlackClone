## About SlackClone

SlackClone is, as the name suggests, a clone of Slack.

Being created for educational purposes, it can be found on my website after completion [here](https://slack.aidanmurphey.com).

"Planned" features:
- Users can create their own server or join existing from invite
- Servers have user groups and can set permissions for certain groups
- Users w/ permission can create/edit channels through which server members can chat
- Chat features? Tagging, (#channel_name and @user_name)
