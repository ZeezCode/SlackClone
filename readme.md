## About SlackClone

SlackClone is, as the name suggests, a clone of Slack.

Being created for educational purposes, it can be found on my website after completion [here](https://slack.aidanmurphey.com).

Planned features for if I pick up this project again in the future:
- Servers have user groups and can set permissions for certain groups
- Profile page for users, others can view and see which public servers you're a member of
